# Web Animation Design

A comprehensive guide for creating animations that feel right, based on Emil Kowalski's "Animations on the Web" course (animations.dev).

## Quick Start

Every animation decision starts with these questions:

1. **Is this element entering or exiting?** → Use `ease-out`
2. **Is an on-screen element moving?** → Use `ease-in-out`
3. **Is this a hover/color transition?** → Use `ease`
4. **Will users see this 100+ times daily?** → Don't animate it

## The Easing Blueprint

### ease-out (Most Common)

Use for **user-initiated interactions**: dropdowns, modals, tooltips, any element entering or exiting the screen.

```css
/* Sorted weak to strong */
--ease-out-quad: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94);
--ease-out-cubic: cubic-bezier(0.215, 0.61, 0.355, 1);
--ease-out-quart: cubic-bezier(0.165, 0.84, 0.44, 1);
--ease-out-quint: cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1);
--ease-out-expo: cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1);
--ease-out-circ: cubic-bezier(0.075, 0.82, 0.165, 1);
```

Why it works: Acceleration at the start creates an instant, responsive feeling. The element "jumps" toward its destination then settles in.

### ease-in-out (For Movement)

Use when **elements already on screen need to move or morph**. Mimics natural motion like a car accelerating then braking.

```css
/* Sorted weak to strong */
--ease-in-out-quad: cubic-bezier(0.455, 0.03, 0.515, 0.955);
--ease-in-out-cubic: cubic-bezier(0.645, 0.045, 0.355, 1);
--ease-in-out-quart: cubic-bezier(0.77, 0, 0.175, 1);
--ease-in-out-quint: cubic-bezier(0.86, 0, 0.07, 1);
--ease-in-out-expo: cubic-bezier(1, 0, 0, 1);
--ease-in-out-circ: cubic-bezier(0.785, 0.135, 0.15, 0.86);
```

### ease (For Hover Effects)

Use for **hover states and color transitions**. The asymmetrical curve (faster start, slower end) feels elegant for gentle animations.

```css
transition: background-color 150ms ease;
```

### linear (Avoid in UI)

Only use for:

- Constant-speed animations (marquees, tickers)
- Time visualization (hold-to-delete progress indicators)

Linear feels robotic and unnatural for interactive elements.

### ease-in (Almost Never)

**Avoid for UI animations.** Makes interfaces feel sluggish because the slow start delays visual feedback.

### Paired Elements Rule

Elements that animate together must use the same easing and duration. Modal + overlay, tooltip + arrow, drawer + backdrop—if they move as a unit, they should feel like a unit.

```css
/* Both use the same timing */
.modal {
  transition: transform 200ms ease-out;
}
.overlay {
  transition: opacity 200ms ease-out;
}
```

## Duration Guidelines

| Element Type                      | Duration  |
| --------------------------------- | --------- |
| Micro-interactions                | 100-150ms |
| Standard UI (tooltips, dropdowns) | 150-250ms |
| Modals, drawers                   | 200-300ms |

**Rules:**
- UI animations should stay under 300ms
- Larger elements animate slower than smaller ones
- Exit animations can be ~20% faster than entrance
- Match duration to distance - longer travel = longer duration

### The Frequency

Determine how often users will see the animation:

- **100+ times/day** → No animation (or drastically reduced)
- **Occasional use** → Standard animation
- **Rare/first-time** → Can be more special

**Example:** Raycast never animates because users open it hundreds of times a day.

## When to Animate

**Do animate:**

- Enter/exit transitions for spatial consistency
- State changes that benefit from visual continuity
- Responses to user actions (feedback)
- Rarely-used interactions where delight adds value

**Don't animate:**

- Keyboard-initiated actions
- Hover effects on frequently-used elements
- Anything users interact with 100+ times daily
- When speed matters more than smoothness

**Marketing vs. Product:**

- Marketing: More elaborate, longer durations allowed
- Product: Fast, purposeful, never frivolous

## Spring Animations

Springs feel more natural because they don't have fixed durations—they simulate real physics.

### When to Use Springs

- Drag interactions with momentum
- Elements that should feel "alive" (Dynamic Island)
- Gestures that can be interrupted mid-animation
- Organic, playful interfaces

### Configuration

**Apple's approach (recommended):**

```js
// Duration + bounce (easier to understand)
{ type: "spring", duration: 0.5, bounce: 0.2 }
```

**Traditional physics:**

```js
// Mass, stiffness, damping (more complex)
{ type: "spring", mass: 1, stiffness: 100, damping: 10 }
```

### Bounce Guidelines

- **Avoid bounce** in most UI contexts
- **Use bounce** for drag-to-dismiss, playful interactions
- Keep bounce subtle (0.1-0.3) when used

### Interruptibility

Springs maintain velocity when interrupted—CSS animations restart from zero. This makes springs ideal for gestures users might change mid-motion.

## Performance

### The Golden Rule

Only animate `transform` and `opacity`. These skip layout and paint stages, running entirely on the GPU.

**Avoid animating:**

- `padding`, `margin`, `height`, `width` (trigger layout)
- `blur` filters above 20px (expensive, especially Safari)
- CSS variables in deep component trees

### Optimization Techniques

```css
/* Force GPU acceleration */
.animated-element {
  will-change: transform;
}
```

**React-specific:**

- Animate outside React's render cycle when possible
- Use refs to update styles directly instead of state
- Re-renders on every frame = dropped frames

**Framer Motion:**

```jsx
// Hardware accelerated (transform as string)
<motion.div animate={{ transform: "translateX(100px)" }} />

// NOT hardware accelerated (more readable)
<motion.div animate={{ x: 100 }} />
```

### CSS vs. JavaScript

- CSS animations run off main thread (smoother under load)
- JS animations (Framer Motion, React Spring) use `requestAnimationFrame`
- CSS better for simple, predetermined animations
- JS better for dynamic, interruptible animations

## Accessibility

Animations can cause motion sickness or distraction for some users.

### prefers-reduced-motion

Whenever you add an animation, also add a media query to disable it:

```css
.modal {
  animation: fadeIn 200ms ease-out;
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .modal {
    animation: none;
  }
}
```

### Reduced Motion Guidelines

- Every animated element needs its own `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- Set `animation: none` or `transition: none` (no `!important`)
- No exceptions for opacity or color - disable all animations
- Show play buttons instead of autoplay videos

### Framer Motion Implementation

```jsx
import { useReducedMotion } from "framer-motion";

function Component() {
  const shouldReduceMotion = useReducedMotion();

  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={shouldReduceMotion ? false : { opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
    />
  );
}
```

### Touch Device Considerations

```css
/* Disable hover animations on touch devices */
@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
  .element:hover {
    transform: scale(1.05);
  }
}
```

Touch devices trigger hover on tap, causing false positives.

## Practical Tips

| Scenario                        | Solution                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Make buttons feel responsive    | Add `transform: scale(0.97)` on `:active`       |
| Element appears from nowhere    | Start from `scale(0.95)`, not `scale(0)`        |
| Shaky/jittery animations        | Add `will-change: transform`                    |
| Hover causes flicker            | Animate child element, not parent               |
| Popover scales from wrong point | Set `transform-origin` to trigger location      |
| Sequential tooltips feel slow   | Skip delay/animation after first tooltip        |
| Small buttons hard to tap       | Use 44px minimum hit area (pseudo-element)      |
| Something still feels off       | Add subtle blur (under 20px) to mask it         |
| Hover triggers on mobile        | Use `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` |

## Easing Decision Flowchart

```
Is the element entering or exiting the viewport?
├── Yes → ease-out
└── No
    ├── Is it moving/morphing on screen?
    │   └── Yes → ease-in-out
    └── Is it a hover change?
        ├── Yes → ease
        └── Is it constant motion?
            ├── Yes → linear
            └── Default → ease-out
```

# Practical Animation Tips

Detailed reference guide for common animation scenarios. Use this as a checklist when implementing animations.

## Recording & Debugging

### Record Your Animations

When something feels off but you can't identify why, record the animation and play it back frame by frame. This reveals details invisible at normal speed.

### Fix Shaky Animations

Elements may shift by 1px at the start/end of CSS transform animations due to GPU/CPU rendering handoff.

**Fix:**

```css
.element {
  will-change: transform;
}
```

This tells the browser to keep the element on the GPU throughout the animation.

### Take Breaks

Don't code and ship animations in one sitting. Step away, return with fresh eyes. The best animations are reviewed and refined over days, not hours.

## Button & Click Feedback

### Scale Buttons on Press

Make interfaces feel responsive by adding subtle scale feedback:

```css
button:active {
  transform: scale(0.97);
}
```

This gives instant visual feedback that the interface is listening.

### Don't Animate from scale(0)

Starting from `scale(0)` makes elements appear from nowhere—it feels unnatural.

**Bad:**

```css
.element {
  transform: scale(0);
}
.element.visible {
  transform: scale(1);
}
```

**Good:**

```css
.element {
  transform: scale(0.95);
  opacity: 0;
}
.element.visible {
  transform: scale(1);
  opacity: 1;
}
```

Elements should always have some visible shape, like a deflated balloon.

## Tooltips & Popovers

### Skip Animation on Subsequent Tooltips

First tooltip: delay + animation. Subsequent tooltips (while one is open): instant, no delay.

```css
.tooltip {
  transition:
    transform 125ms ease-out,
    opacity 125ms ease-out;
  transform-origin: var(--transform-origin);
}

.tooltip[data-starting-style],
.tooltip[data-ending-style] {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: scale(0.97);
}

/* Skip animation for subsequent tooltips */
.tooltip[data-instant] {
  transition-duration: 0ms;
}
```

### Make Animations Origin-Aware

Popovers should scale from their trigger, not from center.

```css
/* Default (wrong for most cases) */
.popover {
  transform-origin: center;
}

/* Correct - scale from trigger */
.popover {
  transform-origin: var(--transform-origin);
}
```

## Speed & Timing

### Keep Animations Fast

A faster-spinning spinner makes apps feel faster even with identical load times. A 180ms select animation feels more responsive than 400ms.

**Rule:** UI animations should stay under 300ms.

### Don't Animate Keyboard Interactions

Arrow key navigation, keyboard shortcuts—these are repeated hundreds of times daily. Animation makes them feel slow and disconnected.

**Never animate:**

- List navigation with arrow keys
- Keyboard shortcut responses
- Tab/focus movements

### Be Careful with Frequently-Used Elements

A hover effect is nice, but if triggered multiple times a day, it may benefit from no animation at all.

**Guideline:** Use your own product daily. You'll discover which animations become annoying through repeated use.

## Hover States

### Fix Hover Flicker

When hover animation changes element position, the cursor may leave the element, causing flicker.

**Problem:**

```css
.box:hover {
  transform: translateY(-20%);
}
```

**Solution:** Animate a child element instead:

```html
<div class="box">
  <div class="box-inner"></div>
</div>
```

```css
.box:hover .box-inner {
  transform: translateY(-20%);
}

.box-inner {
  transition: transform 200ms ease;
}
```

The parent's hover area stays stable while the child moves.

### Disable Hover on Touch Devices

Touch devices don't have true hover. Accidental finger movement triggers unwanted hover states.

```css
@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
  .card:hover {
    transform: scale(1.05);
  }
}
```

## Touch & Accessibility

### Ensure Appropriate Target Areas

Small buttons are hard to tap. Use a pseudo-element to create larger hit areas without changing layout.

**Minimum target:** 44px (Apple and WCAG recommendation)

```css
.touch-hitbox {
  position: relative;
}

.touch-hitbox::before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  display: block;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  min-height: 44px;
  min-width: 44px;
  z-index: 9999;
}
```

## Easing Selection

### Use ease-out for Enter/Exit

Elements entering or exiting should use `ease-out`. The fast start creates responsiveness.

```css
.dropdown {
  transition:
    transform 200ms ease-out,
    opacity 200ms ease-out;
}
```

### Use ease-in-out for On-Screen Movement

Elements already visible that need to move should use `ease-in-out`. Mimics natural acceleration/deceleration like a car.

```css
.slider-handle {
  transition: transform 250ms ease-in-out;
}
```

### Use Custom Easing Curves

Built-in CSS curves are usually too weak. Custom curves create more intentional motion.

**Resources:**

- Course reference: `/learn/easing-curves`
- External: [easings.co](https://easings.co/)

## Visual Tricks

### Use Blur as a Fallback

When easing and timing adjustments don't solve the problem, add subtle blur to mask imperfections.

```css
.button-transition {
  transition:
    transform 150ms ease-out,
    filter 150ms ease-out;
}

.button-transition:active {
  transform: scale(0.97);
  filter: blur(2px);
}
```

**Performance note:** Keep blur under 20px, especially on Safari.

## Why Details Matter

> "All those unseen details combine to produce something that's just stunning, like a thousand barely audible voices all singing in tune."
> — Paul Graham, Hackers and Painters

Details that go unnoticed are good—users complete tasks without friction. Great interfaces enable users to achieve goals with ease, not to admire animations.

# Animations of the future

Static transitions can disrupt the user's sense of flow and orientation. You should envision your interface as a constantly evolving space, where any element can transform into another.

When I shared this transition on Twitter, some people said that this is distracting, but that's exactly the point! By morphing the text we want to emphasize the change, we want to let the user know that the button he is about to press has different consequences.

## Fluidity and perceived performance

Seamless movement in our app can improve user's perception of speed. Below you can see Family's graph transition on the left, and CashApp's static transition on the right. The one on the left seems faster, even though it takes roughly the same time to load.

## Fluid interfaces are hard, especially on the web

A fluid interface on the web, is a seamless interface. Navigating through such interface is effortless for the user. iOS has the tools that enable you to easily achieve this (Swift UI), and, there's much less screen estate, there are more opportunities for meaningful transitions.

There are a lot of flaws in this animation, because I time-boxed myself to 60 minutes to build this component. I wanted to show that perfecting fluid animations is time-consuming, and that's why you don't see them a lot.

In order to achieve a fluid interface, you need to think about the animations before you design the UI. The illustration in the example above is positioned and styled in a way that makes the transition seamless.

## Should I always try to build fluid interfaces?

I can't think of any other app that nails fluidity as well as Family does. You don't see them a lot, because it's time-consuming and requires a lot of thought. If you have the resources and the time, then you should do it. If your product misses features, has bugs, or lacks other important aspects, then you should focus on those first, otherwise, the fluidity will be overshadowed by those issues.

On top of that, the level of fluidity we talked about here is very hard to achieve on the web. I truly believe that more and more companies will start to invest into this, but for now, the technology is not quite there yet.

This chapter is called "Good vs Great animations" though, so I wanted to touch on this subject. I think it's important to know what great looks like, even if it's not really realistic at the moment I believe that this is the future of great web animations.
